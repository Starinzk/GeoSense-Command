# GeoSense-Command
A user-friendly interface for drone pilots and users that reduces cognitive burden while ensuring the safety of flight operations.


Objective: The objective of this project is to design and develop a user-friendly interface for drone pilots and users that reduces cognitive burden while ensuring the safety of flight operations. This will involve creating a real-time, map-based interface for displaying sensor data and controlling physical assets, managing large data streams, and designing immersive image-viewing experiences across web and mobile platforms.
